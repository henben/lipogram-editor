This is a text editor that is designed to make it easier to write lipograms (texts where a specified letter is forbidden).

You can try it out at [lipogram.pages.dev/](https://lipogram.pages.dev/) 

## Features

Select a forbidden letter, and the text editor will prevent you from typing that letter. 

There is an experimental thesaurus feature to suggest synonyms that don't contain the forbidden letter.

There is also a save function which uses local storage in your browser. Do not rely on this to store your work as it can be deleted if you change or reset your browser.

## History

I made this to help me write an entry for the Vocal Media L*pogram Challenge to write a short story without using the letter 'I'.

My story, ["The Ego Death of Agent Thea Claudette"](https://vocal.media/fiction/the-ego-death-of-agent-thea-claudette), won runner-up prize.
